<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Post by <a style="color: #000000;" href="http://digitalhumanities.umass.edu/people/eric-poehler" target="_blank">Eric Poehler</a></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An Open Pompeii, for me, has been a dream since 1998, since the first time I ever thought about the archaeology of the ancient city. That dream is recalled almost every day: each time I need to find an obscure book, make a map, access an archive, or visit a building on the site. The dream became a calling in 2007 when I discovered that a colleague and I had each, unaware of the other, been spending hundreds of hours digitizing the landscape of Pompeii to run our analyses. How much better might those hundreds of hours been spent in the context of our research? How much more might we understand? That experience was the origin of <a href="http://digitalhumanities.umass.edu/pbmp/">Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Project</a> and the beginning of a recognition for me that we are losing information and losing opportunity by failing to cooperate and failing to organize. I was therefore elated to learn of <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/en/">OpenPompei</a> and the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/scriptorivm/">SCRIPTORIVM</a> (and its impressive <a href="https://youtu.be/8Ss-X3245PM">video announcement</a>), not only because it represented a step towards wider collaboration, but also because it came from within the Italian community. I&#8217;d long wished for a like-minded Italian community, and now it seems that wish is coming true. Thus, it seems appropriate to share a few other wishes for Pompeii. What follows is a &#8216;wish list&#8217; of projects that I&#8217;ve been interested to see started, pushed forward, and in some cases to be finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;Spatializing the city&#8221;: Attaching data to places and architectures.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The important explosions of research on Pompeii over the last 250 years on Pompeii have, in one way, been exactly that: intense fragmentations of a unified urban environment into categories of study (archaeology, art history, classics, epigraphy, history, etc&#8230;.), the instruments of scholarly communication (articles, lithographs, manuscripts, and now 3D models), and in many cases literal separation from the city (into museums, private collections, and the pockets of visitors). It is time to bring the data back home. There are innumerable opportunities to put the representations of frescoes, mosaics, inscriptions, and objects back into their natural spatial environments and we are fortunate to have at our disposal remarkable works of aggregation to accomplish this: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/pbmp/items/itemKey/AU548MWR"><em>Pompei. Pitture e Mosaici</em></a>, <a href="http://cil.bbaw.de/cil_en/index_en.html"><em>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</em></a>, <a href="http://www.arborsapientiae.com/pagina/nova_bibliotheca_pompeiana_project.html"><em>Nova Bibliotheca Pompeiana</em></a>, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471012917">Studio sulle provenienze degli oggetti rinvenuti negli scavi borbonici del Regno di Napoli</a>, <a href="http://www.pompeiiinpictures.com/">Pompeii in Pictures</a>, <a href="http://pompei.sns.it/">Fortuna Visiva</a>, among others. Yet we seem to find ourselves in the paradox to stand at once on the shoulders of giants and in their shadows. We have thus far been unable or unwilling to take on both the genius and the failings of these scholars and projects in order to do something more. Happily, this is beginning to change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1739"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://www.google.com.tr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CBwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fancientgraffiti.wlu.edu%2F&amp;ei=W0iiVcGWIYH6UMi-gNAN&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzAPEjhnOIRWOu80k9Pq8hlj9u5w&amp;bvm=bv.97653015,d.d24">Ancient Graffiti Project</a>, lead by <a href="https://wlu.academia.edu/RebeccaBenefiel">Rebecca Benefiel</a> and <a href="https://wlu.academia.edu/SaraSprenkle">Sara Sprenkle</a>, has accepted the challenge to put the epigraphic record back in order, allowing users to search for graffiti by content, class, and location. Imagine (as at least <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/hum/kla/castren/">Paavo Castren</a> and <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/classics/people/academic/mouritsen/index.aspx">Henrik Mouritsen</a> must have done) what questions we might ask about the epigraphic landscape when the physical landscape is a companion rather than an obstacle. I wish this project all the greatest success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We need to do this same work for the frescoes and mosaics. Recently <a href="https://independent.academia.edu/DomenicoEsposito">Domenico Esposito</a> has shown the great value of not only studying a specific wall painting style, but also considering its spread across the city. Surely geographically locating all the information about wall and floor decorations contained in Pompei: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/pbmp/items/itemKey/AU548MWR"><em>Pompei: Pitture e Mosaici</em></a> (PPM) – styles, subject matter, materials, etc. – will create a whole new universe of questions for art historians and others. For those who are interested in this topic, you’ll be happy to know that through the exceptional efforts of some great students (esp. Tess Brickley, Sarah Chen, and Ethan Liu) we have scanned the entire PPM and created a beta CAD file of almost every room in every building in Pompeii, each individually named with the room label given in the PPM. The CAD file is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7dBYnH1y6zMTkhWM1FMVE9fMFU">available here</a>, but for copyright reasons, sections of the PPM scans are <a href="mailto:Pompeiana@gmail.com">available by request</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, recent books and articles by <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853505300">Miko Flohr</a>, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733222938">Steven Ellis</a>, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156956939">Pia Kastenmeier</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/719413261">Nicholas Monteix</a> (among others) have all brought the economic questions of production, consumption, and retail activities down to the level to the individual room. These questions too are ready to be explored further and expanded upon by incorporating their data into a spatial frame. Much of this work has focused on chronological change as well as identification and description, which brings us to an even greater challenge to the spatial representation of Pompeian data: objects and stratigraphy. Like the difficulties the <a href="http://ancientgraffiti.wlu.edu/">Ancient Graffiti Project</a> faces in precisely relocating individual inscriptions, the definition of find spots from the early excavation reports can be a significant challenge. It is one, however, we should no longer avoid for its difficulty. With example of Pim Allison’s work on the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646790665">Casa del Menandro</a> and the publication of the Bourbon era finds by <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471012917">Pagano and Prisciandaro</a> we are in a better place to consider the value of the finds record both the level of the individual room or building and at the scale of the entire city. Once again with the help of fantastic students (<a href="https://ancientmaterialworlds.wordpress.com/archive/pompeii/">Pompeii 492a</a>, Spring 2015) I have been able to digitize and transform Pagano and Prisciandaro’s table of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HdNKBsCbkiumfjfMr5DObTrQzh2kQhwLbht7Hv0EWL8/edit#gid=1060521240">finds of the early excavations</a> and they are now ready for the careful, hard work of attaching them to the urban landscape. The finds records from modern excavations – and more importantly, their stratigraphic descriptions &#8211; have even richer and denser evidence to offer. Many research projects have GIS and digital recording procedures incorporated into their fieldwork practices and I urge them to share those data as soon as they are able, perhaps even as part of their initial reports, but hopefully not long after final publication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://www.umass.edu/classics/PQP">Pompeii Quadriporticus Project</a> will soon be doing just that: sharing in multiple formats the outputs of our research for scholars and the lay public alike. We’ve already begun <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/75393016@N07/">sharing our images</a>. For scholars, we anticipate soon sharing tabular and descriptive data accompanied by drawings and matrices of our interpretations, further supported by <a href="http://p3d.in/u/epoehler">3D renderings</a> and GPR results. For the public, and especially for visitors to Pompeii, we are planning to create online a series of nested histories of the Quadriporticus – growing in detail and complexity as the user desires – that are geolocated so that, like targeted advertisements, people can read about the past on their own device without large placards detracting from the experience of the past. There are countless areas of the city that can benefit from the same kind of geolocated information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Equally, there are countless documents that are waiting in archives and libraries that need to be online and available for use. Archives like those of <a href="http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/2002.M.16/2002.M.16.xml">Halstead van der Poel in the Getty</a> (which draws on Warscher documents), or those collections of papers of former superintendents <a href="http://www.amicidipompei.com/riviste/1294757721.pdf">recently discussed in the Rivista di Studi Pompeiani</a> hold a unique set of information and unique perspective on the great excavations and research agendas of the 20th century. To that end, perhaps it is time to consider an oral history project of the many important Pompeian scholars – previous superintendents and directors of the site, heads of foreign research projects, independent researchers, etc. – whose work asked the questions that we in the 21st century are now trying to answer. For the 18th and 19th centuries, collections of artworks and maps can offer a great deal of evidence about the early excavations. Projects such as the excellent <a href="http://pompei.sns.it/">Fortuna Visiva</a> are already in place, but the need for systematic and comprehensive collection and<em> open sharing</em> of these illustrative documents remains a desideratum. In exploring the question of early maps, once again with my students, we created a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/class492a/items">Zotero site of the maps</a> known in the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8667821">Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum</a> and attempted to locate and some cases, digitize these maps. Combining a complete list of maps of the excavations with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7dBYnH1y6zMTkhWM1FMVE9fMFU">CAD file of room-level spaces</a>, it will be possible to create a maps that shows the 250 year process, year-by-year and in some cases day-by-day, of Pompeii’s disinterment. The pace of excavation, the recovery of objects, the locations of work, all can be normalized and made comparable by the giving them spatial properties in a GIS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the <a href="https://www.academia.edu/2493873/Pompeii_Bibliography_and_Mapping_Project">PBMP</a>, there’s a short wish list of features and capabilities that I’m hopeful to realize in the future. The first is the creation of a means to discover, receive, and ingest new citations into the bibliography. This is a problem with many obvious open access and community-based solutions in addition to need for the technical expertise to implement it. A second desired feature is a natural language processing procedure to parse the many full-text objects attached (or in the process of being attached) to our bibliography in order to find all – and all the meaningful – locations in Pompeii mentioned in the text. What is meaningfully discussed in a text and what is merely mentioned, and which does the user need, are issues to resolve. Next on the list is a flexible and intuitive design for a versioning archive of the spatial data with the purpose to serve not only the different versions of the PBMP base data, but also to make available the many different interpretations of the site that are represented by different shapes of space. That shops are attached to the shape of a house, or not, has important ramifications for how we interpret the entire ancient city from a number of perspectives: when attached one assumes economic dependence if not direct ownership of the shop by the house; when separate, one presents a landscape of far greater independence in property ownership and the assumption of an economic class to own those shops. The shape of space matters and it is crucial not to hard code historically meaningful assumptions into digital representations without making those assumptions explicit AND without offering at least the opportunity to choose a different set data with a different set of assumptions. Finally, I’m wanting and working toward a connection from the bibliography to the GIS such that when bibliographic search results are returned, the meaningful locations contained within those results are displayed on a map to accompany the list of citations. I’ve called this an “instant gazetteer” that will change and narrow with every new search.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are some of the more GIS based items on my “wish list” for an Open Pompeii. Nearly all of these projects can start with the initiative of a single person who is fascinated by Pompeii and who believes that fascination will only grow through engagement and contribution. Anyone can find and add content to online platforms: citations, maps, artworks, etc. Secondary teachers and university professors can engage their students in projects that not only educate, but also don’t waste the effort expended in the process of learning. Build lessons that build things. Let me unpack that a bit further by analogy. Lifting weights builds muscles. What if the movement of those weights could be used to power the lights at the gym? Learning builds intelligence. What if the act of learning increased the total ‘weight’ of content for the next act of learning? Events like <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/scriptorivm/">SCRIPTORIVM</a> and community-building groups like <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/en/">OpenPompei</a> are especially important right now as we regularly lose as much information about the ancient world into silos of data as we do from the continuous, if irregular collapses of walls and crumbling of plasters. Even some conservation efforts conceal evidence in the name of preserving it: one needs only to look at the long tradition of covering walls with a mortar to prevent its erosion, but at the cost of hiding all the details of its history of construction. While the community of Pompeianisti cannot save the site directly, we can do incredible work to support the work of conservation by providing a broad, dynamic, and most of all open sets of data that can be used in planning and research. Surely the worst thing we might do is to squander the resources we have by duplicating efforts the way my colleague and I did back in 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a researcher, I&#8217;ve realized it is not within my expertise to claim (though I’m not without opinions) what are the best ways to save and/or to use Pompeii. As a foreigner, moreover, it’s not my place to make demands. But, as one of many committed specialists and community members, I can make a difference. In my case, I can put aside the natural inclinations to retain control over the data and research products I’ve produced (and, importantly, paid for) and “give it away” to others in imperfect, incomplete, or “in progress” forms. My aims are not wholly altruistic, however. I do want and do claim authorship and credit for the digital products I’ve made and I do hope that in making them widely available those digital objects will build a legacy for the efforts that created them. At the same time, I also wish to be part of an on-going philosophical shift in the way that we create and share data, especially academic data. It is a shift that we desperately need. In my opinion, building a data set or even describing that data in a narrative is no longer enough, one needs to take their ultimate validation in the number of people those data reach and how many choose to use it. For academics, such a shift is not merely structural; its not about how we peer-review databases or how we evaluate digital work. It’s also a cultural shift. We need to learn to be comfortable with the reality that data are messy and to share them anyway. We need to be willing to move the entire discipline ahead, along with our own specific publications, by sharing imperfect, incomplete, and in-progress works. And yes, we need to do this within the structures of academic labor and power (i.e., hiring, promotion, and tenure).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s so very much more to say on this topic and at another time I probably will. For this discussion I’ll leave it here by thanking OpenPompei and SCRIPTORIVM for letting me contribute to their noble cause and by taking my own advice, letting the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7dBYnH1y6zMeVZtRl9Idllpems">most recent GIS data of the PBMP</a> – imperfect, incomplete, and in-progress as they are– go off for the betterment of our Pompeian community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pompeii1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1530" src="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pompeii1.png" alt="Pompeii" width="574" height="340" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spring 2013. </strong>It&#8217;s a strange place for the first team meeting face to face: we come from different cities and we meet at the train Circumvesuviana stop &#8220;Villa dei Misteri&#8221;.<br />
For the first time the team of OpenPompei meets the Pompei Superintendent. We are here to support the transparency policies of the Grande Progetto Pompei and, starting from open data, experiment with active citizens a new proactive relationship with the archaeological site most talked-about in the world.<br />
We are welcomed with curiosity and a lot of questions: what could mean transparency in Pompeii? What kind of effects could it produce? The best way to answer is to show a demo, which gives a concrete idea of ​​how you might see archaeological, scientific and economic data about restoration and securing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While a part of the team works on the demo, some of us starts a journey around Pompeii , Naples, Salerno, Aversa looking for active citizens and innovators. What is the link between this research and the transparency of the Grande Progetto Pompei? With the aim to rethink the relationship between citizens and the archaeological area, we believe that we must collaborate with the people who in Pompeii and in other parts of Campania are rethinking a new way of living their land?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summer 2013</strong>. The trips continue, around <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/06/01/2-post-per-1-viaggio-parte-seconda/" target="_blank">confiscated property</a> and <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/07/24/nuovopassato/" target="_blank">summer school about rural innovation</a>, <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/05/31/2-post-per-1-viaggio/" target="_blank">social innovators on bike</a> and <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/05/03/in-avanscoperta/" target="_blank">young&#8217;s cooperatives in the suburbs of Naples</a>. Meanwhile the demo is presented to the Superintendency. It&#8217;s a big surprise for them discovering the Pompeii map detailed as the one on OpenStreetMap, with icons linked to economic and scientific data, images, easy to consult. But we have no time to gain the first data of Grande Progetto Pompei because a political transition period changes our stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Autumn &#8211; winter 2013/2014. </strong>A political change leads to a new Superintendent, from Dr. Cinquantaquattro to Dr. Osanna, and the foundation of the General Direction of the Grande Progetto Pompei headed by Generale Nistri. The period of adjustement is longer than we expect and so we have the only chance to focus our activities exclusively on civic hacking. So we begin to build upon the relationships created during the research journey. We support two projects of the Department of the politics of development and cohesion. We collaborate with Kublai to organize the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/11/11/il-kublai-award-a-napoli-venite/" target="_blank">Kublai Award in Naples</a>. <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2014/02/05/piccoli-cittadini-attivi-crescono-la-nostra-collaborazione-con-a-scuola-di-opencoesione/" target="_blank">We support A Scuola di OpenCoesione</a>, an experimental school project in seven Italian cities, including Naples, to build interdisciplinary educational paths starting from the civic monitoring of projects financed by the cohesion policies, using the portal data OpenCoesione. With the team of A Scuola di OpenCoesione we go for three lectures in Naples high school and the energy is incredible. During our travel, we visit a lot of properties confiscated at the Camorra, so we create a collaboration with <a href="http://www.monithon.it/" target="_blank">Monithon</a> and togheter with Libera we organize <a href="http://www.monithon.it/blog/2014/03/10/opmeeting-con-open-pompei-e-libera-parte-la-mappatura-dei-beni-confiscati-alle-mafie/" target="_blank">#OPMeeting</a>: a two-days of civic monitoring in 3 confiscated properties in the Vesuvius area. #OPMeeting is the occasion to create a group of citizens that, a month later, generates a kind of &#8220;spin off&#8221; of OpenPompei, a real proud for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spring &#8211; Summer 2014.</strong> In fact during the Spaghetti Open Data meeting, inside an hackathon led by Andrea Borrusowas the group realizes <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2014/05/19/confiscati-bene-un-progetto-che-nasce-da-openpompei/" target="_blank">Confiscati Bene</a>, a platform that collects, analyzes and monitoring the informations and the projects about the properties confiscated to organized crime. The idea was born to give order and an easy access to informations not available or fragmented and incompleted into different maps and sites. In the same period, the door of the Grande Progetto Pompei is opened again and so begin meetings with the General Direction for pick up our work at the support of transparency of Grande Progetto Pompei</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fall-Winter 2014-2015.</strong> After a summer of hard and silent work, in September  <a href="http://open.pompeiisites.org/" target="_blank">the transparency portal of the Great Pompeii Project</a> is on line and constantly updated. In the meantime, we dono&#8217; t stop the civic hacking activities. We collaborate with Wiki Loves Monuments to gain, for the first time from the Superintendency of Pompeii, the permission to partecipate at the contest. We also organize a <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2014/10/03/opensafari-un-grazie-fotografico/" target="_blank">photo safari</a> giving away 100 tickets to take a great numer of photos, not only for the contest, but also to increase the Wikimedia Commons database. Also the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/tag/premiazione/" target="_blank">Wiki Loves Monuments award</a> is organized in the archaeological park. we close this rich winter woth the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2015/03/12/ad-maiora-2/" target="_blank">STVDIVM</a>, a school of open archaeological data, in collaboration with the MIBACT, the Superintendency of Pompeii and the General Direction of the Grande Progetto Pompei, which involves 22 archaeologists from all over Italy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we live the last season of OpenPompei. Our commitment to support the policies of transparency of the Grande Progetto Pompei goes on and for our small community of open archaeologists and for all the citizens who want to take care of Pompeii, are coming more and more surprises and we have the time to build together others moments.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/STVDIVM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1471" src="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/STVDIVM.png" alt="STVDIVM" width="843" height="344" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The STVDIVM is over: our laptops are now turned off and everyone is returning home, carrying a set of new skills and fresh relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We brought together twenty-four archaeologists, including students, researchers, professionals, and MiBACT’s employees (from the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage). No one before had ever dove so deep into the world of Archaeological Open Data. During the three days meeting, they received and processed much information, and they soiled their hand with data: downloading, cleaning and publishing them. They also debated about legal and ethical issues, and about licenses. Sometimes their eyes popped out of their heads while looking at the magic of Open Data. More important though, they realised that working with data is not the same as working with Open Data. Data are always data, but open data enhances their potential thanks to the ability of amplifying community engagement and collaboration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We won’t tell you word for word what happened, but what you should know is that we definitely kept our <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2015/02/04/open-archaeological-data-in-pompeii/">promises</a>. Going beyond the theoretical and practical concepts, what was really important is the step forward made in shaping a community of people driven by the idea of sharing data as a way to deeply innovate and transform Archaeology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What the attendees at the STVDIVM truly understood is that working with oOpen dData – and sharing them – implies the development of an open and inclusive community, in which each and everyone is able to advance the knowledge, generating a positive and collective value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the birth of what we can define a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">community of practice</a>: a network of informal communication linking a group of professionals (archaeologists, in our case) working and learning together, always relying on each other’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Archaeology the community of practice should not be limited solely to the excavation team, but it should be rather defined as an international and multidisciplinary virtual community. The enormous potential of data sharing through the Internet allows us archaeologists to constitute ourselves as a scientific community of practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Raw data is indeed the fundamental building block of any research, and anyone working in this field has to turn to it in order to develop new hypothesis or historical reconstructions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might start slowly at first – we have seen it already in  Pisa <a href="http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/open-school-of-archaeological-data/">Open School of Archaeological Data</a> – but eventually the data-sharing culture gets contagious, and the Archaeological Data Therapy always produces new ideas in those who received it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Pisa meeting in July brought to the creation of <a href="http://www.modarc.org">MODA</a> (Archaeological Open Data Manifesto), intended to shape the identity of the newly born community and to define its goals. After the meeting in Pompeii, the community makes another step forward with the decision of building a collaborative platform, used to gather and share raw data, and, with the help of the community, to prepare them for publishing as open datasets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing data in open format implies a choice that is in the first place cultural rather than technological. Let’s take this route and technology will follow, giving us all the tools needed to overcome the hurdles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Particle physicists have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv">ArXiv</a>.<br />
Archaeologists will have TABVLARIVM.<br />
And that&#8217;s a promise.</p>
