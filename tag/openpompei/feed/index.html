<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>(Tito Livio, Ab urbe condita; XXXVIII, 25)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Towards SCRIPTORIVM: OpenPompei at CAA2015 (II part)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2015/03/30/similes-cum-similibus-facillime-congregantur-3/">As we have already told you</a>, OpenPompei has taken part in the<a href="http://caa-international.org/about/"> Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology</a> (CAA) Annual Conference and, as desired, we met many “open archaeologists” to involve in SCRIPTORIVM. But especially we took part in the presentation of MODA, the Italian Manifesto of Archaeological Open Data. We want to support the rising archaeological community interested in opening and sharing data beyond our project’ end. We believe that OpenPompei is like an enzyma that can accelerate the building of a new management of Cultural Heritage based (also) on Open Data. So, as the name of the CAA Annual Conference recited, “keep the revolution going”! The Manifesto could be the first step in this direction!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><b>#epicfail? Has Open Source in Archeology failed?</b></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the provocative title of <a href="http://www.mappaproject.org/">Mappa Project</a> speech in <a href="http://www.archeofoss.org/2015/03/archeofoss-2015-il-programma/">ArcheFOSS session</a>, in which it tries to answer this question: why in the last years the impact of Open Source in Archaeology has been so limited?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><iframe style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46639963" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two main reasons can be identified.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>the absence of  a more theoretical approach</strong>: <em> “Open source was a computer science issue, the transposition to archaeology was not associated with a strong theoretical approach. Open Source was not able to propose new development, new forms of doing archaeology, that include new ways, and standards, of handling, processing and modeling information. (&#8230;) Open Source in archaeology goes beyond the mere application of software, in fact, it represents an area where archaeologists can focus on discussion about the nature of archaeological data, their definition, representation and manipulation.”</em></li>
<li><strong>the absence of education and formation in Open Source skills:</strong> <em>“it’s necessary to provide future archaeologists with a level of competency both in archaeology and computer science (&#8230;). Only proper training can permit them to engage in the development of new IT tools consonant with archaeological interests, and to foster a deeper conceptual understanding of how applications work as a necessary step towards the creation of new ones.&#8221;</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MODA</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.modarc.org/">MODA</a> is a <b>declaration of intent</b> about the right of open access to archaeological data of entire citizenship. All archaeological remains are part of humanity&#8217;s legacy. As such, they belong to all of us, together with the information connected to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was born by a group of archaeologists from different backgrounds and arose from the experience of the first Open School of Archaeological Data, promoted by the MAPPA Lab of the University of Pisa in July 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone worked in different places, studied in different Universities, but all agreed about creating and sharing data in open format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another opportunity to broaden and strengthen the rising archaeological community was the STVDIVM, promoted by OpenPompei project. Educational meetings such as these, promote the birth of a community of practice, that is a network of informal communication, linking a group of archaeologists working and learning together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since October 29, 2014, 130 people have signed the Manifesto and also the following projects (besides OpenPompei): Wikimedia Italia, Mappa Project, <a href="http://digilab.uniroma1.it/centro/i-laboratori/openlab-cultura/laboratorio-archeoarte-3d-lab">Archeo ed Arte 3D</a> &#8211; La Sapienza.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Why are Open Data so important in Archaeology?</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forty years of stratigraphic excavations have produced thousands, billions of data. Data-harvesting have an expansive cost. So, why do not we re-use data?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through use and re-use of Archaeological Data, we will able to make really cost- effective our data-harvesting, optimizing production costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These practical considerations must be added to another one: opening and sharing Open Data generates a virtuous circle. By this one, both <b><i>scientific community</i></b> and <b><i>citizens as a whole</i></b> can benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The virtuous circle of Archaeological Open Data consists of:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>making </b> <b><i>data-harvesting process</i></b><b> transparent through sharing Open Data:</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">an archaeologist works like an antenna receiving signals from the past, decoding and then retransmitting them. The signals were reduced by the long-time and are definitively destroyed by excavations themselves. We will able to verify several times the interpretation process: sharing Open Data we can ask them new questions, generating new knowledge;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>working together quickly and creatively to improve archaeology:</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">with the increasing availability of more data processable we will able to create new perspective for the research;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>encouraging ethical behaviour:</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">information sharing makes everyone responsable for protecting Cultural Heritage and leading the foundations for a shared management of Cultural Heritage itself;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>promoting the development of innovative services </b>saving time and costs in the management of Archaeological Heritage</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>create value and accountability for cultural institutions</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>We believe that in this way Archaeology regain a strong social relevance as a public service</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>An European Manifesto</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an Italian pilot project, but the instance of opening and sharing the raw data could be an instance of all european archaeologists. Every country have a different situation about attitude, laws and management of archaeological information. But the goal could be the same: reinforced our research-methodology in order to enhance historical landscape preservation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SCRIPTORIVM: the next-live event!</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG-20150402-WA0015.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1552  aligncenter" src="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG-20150402-WA0015-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG-20150402-WA0015" width="332" height="249" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This rising open archaeological community will meet again at SCRIPTORIVM. The participation of MODA’ members at this event is purposeful: we will go from theory to practice of ha(r)ckeology starting from a site of symbolic value as Pompeii!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Keep the revolution going!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pompeii1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1530" src="http://www.openpompei.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pompeii1.png" alt="Pompeii" width="574" height="340" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spring 2013. </strong>It&#8217;s a strange place for the first team meeting face to face: we come from different cities and we meet at the train Circumvesuviana stop &#8220;Villa dei Misteri&#8221;.<br />
For the first time the team of OpenPompei meets the Pompei Superintendent. We are here to support the transparency policies of the Grande Progetto Pompei and, starting from open data, experiment with active citizens a new proactive relationship with the archaeological site most talked-about in the world.<br />
We are welcomed with curiosity and a lot of questions: what could mean transparency in Pompeii? What kind of effects could it produce? The best way to answer is to show a demo, which gives a concrete idea of ​​how you might see archaeological, scientific and economic data about restoration and securing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While a part of the team works on the demo, some of us starts a journey around Pompeii , Naples, Salerno, Aversa looking for active citizens and innovators. What is the link between this research and the transparency of the Grande Progetto Pompei? With the aim to rethink the relationship between citizens and the archaeological area, we believe that we must collaborate with the people who in Pompeii and in other parts of Campania are rethinking a new way of living their land?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summer 2013</strong>. The trips continue, around <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/06/01/2-post-per-1-viaggio-parte-seconda/" target="_blank">confiscated property</a> and <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/07/24/nuovopassato/" target="_blank">summer school about rural innovation</a>, <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/05/31/2-post-per-1-viaggio/" target="_blank">social innovators on bike</a> and <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/05/03/in-avanscoperta/" target="_blank">young&#8217;s cooperatives in the suburbs of Naples</a>. Meanwhile the demo is presented to the Superintendency. It&#8217;s a big surprise for them discovering the Pompeii map detailed as the one on OpenStreetMap, with icons linked to economic and scientific data, images, easy to consult. But we have no time to gain the first data of Grande Progetto Pompei because a political transition period changes our stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Autumn &#8211; winter 2013/2014. </strong>A political change leads to a new Superintendent, from Dr. Cinquantaquattro to Dr. Osanna, and the foundation of the General Direction of the Grande Progetto Pompei headed by Generale Nistri. The period of adjustement is longer than we expect and so we have the only chance to focus our activities exclusively on civic hacking. So we begin to build upon the relationships created during the research journey. We support two projects of the Department of the politics of development and cohesion. We collaborate with Kublai to organize the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2013/11/11/il-kublai-award-a-napoli-venite/" target="_blank">Kublai Award in Naples</a>. <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2014/02/05/piccoli-cittadini-attivi-crescono-la-nostra-collaborazione-con-a-scuola-di-opencoesione/" target="_blank">We support A Scuola di OpenCoesione</a>, an experimental school project in seven Italian cities, including Naples, to build interdisciplinary educational paths starting from the civic monitoring of projects financed by the cohesion policies, using the portal data OpenCoesione. With the team of A Scuola di OpenCoesione we go for three lectures in Naples high school and the energy is incredible. During our travel, we visit a lot of properties confiscated at the Camorra, so we create a collaboration with <a href="http://www.monithon.it/" target="_blank">Monithon</a> and togheter with Libera we organize <a href="http://www.monithon.it/blog/2014/03/10/opmeeting-con-open-pompei-e-libera-parte-la-mappatura-dei-beni-confiscati-alle-mafie/" target="_blank">#OPMeeting</a>: a two-days of civic monitoring in 3 confiscated properties in the Vesuvius area. #OPMeeting is the occasion to create a group of citizens that, a month later, generates a kind of &#8220;spin off&#8221; of OpenPompei, a real proud for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spring &#8211; Summer 2014.</strong> In fact during the Spaghetti Open Data meeting, inside an hackathon led by Andrea Borrusowas the group realizes <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2014/05/19/confiscati-bene-un-progetto-che-nasce-da-openpompei/" target="_blank">Confiscati Bene</a>, a platform that collects, analyzes and monitoring the informations and the projects about the properties confiscated to organized crime. The idea was born to give order and an easy access to informations not available or fragmented and incompleted into different maps and sites. In the same period, the door of the Grande Progetto Pompei is opened again and so begin meetings with the General Direction for pick up our work at the support of transparency of Grande Progetto Pompei</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fall-Winter 2014-2015.</strong> After a summer of hard and silent work, in September  <a href="http://open.pompeiisites.org/" target="_blank">the transparency portal of the Great Pompeii Project</a> is on line and constantly updated. In the meantime, we dono&#8217; t stop the civic hacking activities. We collaborate with Wiki Loves Monuments to gain, for the first time from the Superintendency of Pompeii, the permission to partecipate at the contest. We also organize a <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2014/10/03/opensafari-un-grazie-fotografico/" target="_blank">photo safari</a> giving away 100 tickets to take a great numer of photos, not only for the contest, but also to increase the Wikimedia Commons database. Also the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/tag/premiazione/" target="_blank">Wiki Loves Monuments award</a> is organized in the archaeological park. we close this rich winter woth the <a href="http://www.openpompei.it/2015/03/12/ad-maiora-2/" target="_blank">STVDIVM</a>, a school of open archaeological data, in collaboration with the MIBACT, the Superintendency of Pompeii and the General Direction of the Grande Progetto Pompei, which involves 22 archaeologists from all over Italy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we live the last season of OpenPompei. Our commitment to support the policies of transparency of the Grande Progetto Pompei goes on and for our small community of open archaeologists and for all the citizens who want to take care of Pompeii, are coming more and more surprises and we have the time to build together others moments. A diary of the past seasons is a run-up before the end of the project.</p>
